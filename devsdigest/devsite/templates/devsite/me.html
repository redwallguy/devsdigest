  <p>My name is Dev Vibhu Someshwar. I'm an aspiring software developer looking
  to land his first job. While I am most knowledgable in Python and Javscript, I
  also am handy with HTML, CSS, and SQL. Furthermore, I am willing and eager to
  learn new languages and frameworks, and expand my programming knowledge.</p>
  <p>When I am not coding, I can generally be found reading fantasy novels,
  surfing Wikipedia, playing games with my friends, or doing a few rounds of
  vigorous ping-pong.</p>

  <p>I have designed and launched many projects in my time in software development.
  A few examples are showcased <a href="/projects">here.</a></p>
